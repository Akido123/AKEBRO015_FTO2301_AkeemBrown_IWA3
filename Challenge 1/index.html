<!--
	Why - configuration variables are do not have the key word "export", and in script, configuration variables are imported wrong; there are no curly brackets around the variables and the key word "from" is spelled "form".
	What - I added the "export" key word before the variables, and added curly brackets around the imported variables and correctly spelled the key word "from".
	Others - the configuration code is short enough to add it to the base script.
